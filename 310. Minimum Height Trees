//we need to find the mid points.
//mid points can be one or two.


// because if we make the leaves or next to leaves as root, then length would be greater.

// for the minimum heights , root should be as closes to root.

// for even length -edges- > 2 roots
// for odd length - 1 root.





// How to find leaves..and How to find root.

// Leaves are the nodes tht have indegree 1
// and leaves to next nodes will have indegree 2

// this goes on..

// so something like toposort logic we can use...

// but indegree if it becomes one if after removing leaf, then
// consider that.

// repear this until there are 2 node remaining....

// so we need to keep track of processd nodes as well.
