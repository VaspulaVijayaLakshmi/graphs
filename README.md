How to identify DSU?
Well, in questions where we are asked to reach one node from another, or where we need to attach nodes or form components of similiar types,
we go with DSU. In DSU questions, most of the time, we are not given any extra conditions on the path, like shortest, longest, etc. We just need to find if we could reach from one node to another.
